### Hi there ðŸ‘‹
I'm Suhail Ahmed, CSE AI&ML '23 from VIT Chennai. I'm currently trying to learn as much as I possibly can and use it to build meaningful (and of course, cool) projects. I'm drawn to the creative aspect of coding and love nothing more than to kick back and code something fun while listening to music.

### ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on ...
- Some automation projects for work.
- A side project that aids in the learning process: Learn in Bit.
- Delving into the math of ML.
